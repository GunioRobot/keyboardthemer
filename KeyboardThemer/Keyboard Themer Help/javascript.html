  JavaScript is the popular scripting language used in web
  browsers. Keyboard Themer's <b>JavaScript Effect</b> embeds the V8
  JavaScript interpreter used by Google Chrome to let you write custom
  effects in JavaScript. Scripting your keyboard with JavaScript is a
  good choice when you want to react to key presses, design animated
  effects, or download webpages and light up keys depending on the
  contents of pages. If you want to integrate with other applications
  on your computer, <a href="applescript.html">AppleScript
  effects</a> are a better choice.
</p>
<p>
  If you are new to JavaScript, you should
  read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742?ie=UTF8&tag=dcooneycom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596517742">JavaScript:
  The Good
  Parts</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=dcooneycom-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596517742"
  width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none
  !important; margin:0px !important;" />; it is a concise guide to
  using JavaScript effectively.
</p>

<h2>Getting Started with JavaScript Effects</h2>
<p>
  To write a JavaScript effect, drag one from the available effects to
  the applied effects. You type JavaScript source code into
  the <b>Effect Settings</b> panel and click the <b>Play</b> button to
  start the interpreter. After you change an effect, you should toggle
  the Play button again so the interpreter picks up your changes.
</p>
<p>
  The <code>keys</code> object lets you set the color and opacity of
  each key by name&mdash;see the <a href="keys.html">key name
  reference</a> for a complete list of names. You specify colors and
  opacity with a JavaScript object literal
  with <code>r</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>b</code>
  and <code>a</code> properties for the red, green, blue and alpha
  components respectively. Each component ranges from 0.0
  (black/transparent) to 1.0 (bright/opaque). For example, <code>{r:
  0.0, g: 0.0, b: 1.0, a: 0.75}</code> is 75% opaque blue. If you omit
  the alpha component, opaque (<code>1.0</code>) is assumed. For
  example, the following code sets the 'A' key bright red:
</p>
<pre class="example">
keys['A'] = {r: 1.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0};
</pre>
<p>
  When your effect is visible and the keyboard is plugged in, your
  script is called once. If you want to change keys over time you can
  use the <code>setTimeout</code> function, described below, to update
  keys. If you want to develop an animated effect your script can
  include a <code>draw</code> function. Keyboard Themer will call
  your <code>draw</code> function as fast as the keyboard can be
  updated; your <code>draw</code> method should update the keys as
  quickly as possible. For example, this script blinks the ~ key as
  quickly as possible:
</p>
<pre class="example">
var on = false;

function draw() {
  keys['~'] = on ? {r: 0.0, g: 0.0, b: 1.0} : {a: 0.0};
  on = !on;
}
</pre>
<p>
  You should also use the <code>draw</code> method if you want to
  respond to key presses. The <code>isPressed</code> property will
  tell you if a key is being held down, but because a key could be
  pressed and released between calls to <code>draw</code>, there are
  two other properties&mdash;<code>up</code>
  and <code>down</code>&mdash;that tell you if a key was pressed
  (<code>down</code>) and/or released (<code>up</code>) since the last
  time <code>draw</code> was called. For example, the following script
  lights up keys as they're pressed, and keeps them illuminated if
  they're held down:
</p>
<pre class="example">
function draw() {
  keys.clear();
  for (var key in keys) {
    if (keys[key].isPressed || keys[key].down) {
      keys[key] = {r: 1.0, g: 1.0, b: 1.0};
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
  This also demonstrates using JavaScript's <code>for (... in
  ...)</code> syntax to do something with all of the keys.
</p>
<p>
  If access for assistive devices isn't
  enabled, <code>isPressed</code>, <code>up</code>
  and <code>down</code> will always be <code>false</code>. To enable
  access for assistive devices, open <b>System Preferences</b>,
  click <b>Universal Access</b>, and check the <b>Enable access for
  assistive devices</b> checkbox.
</p>

<h2>Function Reference</h2>
<p>
  This section documents the functions and objects that are unique to
  Keyboard Themer. JavaScript effects can also access the typical
  built-in JavaScript objects such
  as <code>Object</code>, <code>String</code>, <code>Date</code>, <code>Array</code>
  and so on, and any serious effect will probably need to. Note that
  the objects related to the web browser, such as
  the <code>window</code> object, aren't available in Keyboard Themer.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>download(<span class="variable">url</span>, {
onComplete: <span class="variable">callback</span>,
onError: <span class="variable">callback</span> })</code></dt>
<dd>
  Downloads the specified URL. When the download is finished,
  the <code>onComplete</code> callback is called with the text of the
  downloaded content. If there's a problem the <code>onError</code>
  callback is called instead with a descriptive error
  message. The <code>onError</code> callback is optional.
<pre class="example">
var re = /href="\/q\?s=(\w+)([^<]|(<[^a]))*?color:#([a-fA-F0-9]{6});/g;

download('http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=AAPL+MSFT+YHOO+GOOG', {
  onComplete: function (page) {
    var m;
    while (m = re.exec(page)) {
      keys[m[1][0]] = m[4];
    }
  },
  onError: log
});
</pre>
  Don't call <code>download</code> every time <code>draw</code> is
  called&mdash;that would result in over three hundred requests per
  minute. Use <code>setTimeout</code>, or examine the time with
  a <code>Date</code> object, or use a counter to only make a request
  once every 2000 or so calls to <code>draw</code> (there are about
  six calls to <code>draw</code> every second, so doing something once
  every 1,800 calls means doing it once roughly every five minutes.)
</dd>
<dt><code>keys[<span class="variable">name</span>]</code> [ <code>= <span class="variable">color</span></code> ]</dt>
<dd>
  Gets or sets the color of the <code class="variable">name</code>
  key. Colors can be RRGGBB hex strings&mdash;for
  example <code>'#FF0000'</code> is bright red&mdash;or objects
  with <code>r</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>b</code>
  and <code>a</code> properties for the red, green, blue and alpha
  color components respectively. The component values should be
  between 0.0 and 1.0, for example, <code>{r: 0.0, g: 1.0, b: 0.0, a:
  0.8}</code> is bright green with 80% opacity.
</dd>
<dt><code>keys[<span class="variable">name</span>].down</code></dt>
<dd>
  Gets whether the specified key was pressed since the last
  time <code>draw</code> was called. This property is
  only <code>true</code> when the key is first pressed, it then flips
  back to <code>false</code> (use the <code>isPressed</code> property
  if you want to track whether the key is held down.)
</dd>
<dt><code>keys[<span class="variable">name</span>].up</code></dt>
<dd>
  Gets whether the specified key was released since the last
  time <code>draw</code> was called.
</dd>
<dt><code>keys[<span class="variable">name</span>].isPressed</code></dt>
<dd>
  Gets whether the specified key is being held down.
</dd>
<dt><code>keys.paint(<span class="variable">color</span>, <span class="variable">key</span></code> [<code>, <span class="variable">key</span>,</code> ...]<code>)</code></dt>
<dd>
  Paints the specified keys with a color. <code>paint</code> is
  different from setting the color of a key directly in the way
  transparency is handled: if the specified color is
  transparent, <code>paint</code> blends it with the color that is
  already in the <code>keys</code> object.
</dd>
<dt><code>keys.clear(</code>[<code class="variable">color</code>]<code>)</code></dt>
<dd>
  Sets all of the keys to be completely transparent; effects
  underneath the script effect will shine through. If a color is
  specified, all of the keys are set to that color instead.
</dd>
<dt><code>log(<span class="variable">msg</span>)</code></dt>
<dd>
  Logs <code class="variable">msg</code> to the console at the bottom
  of the effect settings panel, if the effects settings panel is
  visible.
</dd>
<dt><code>setTimeout(<span class="variable">callback</span>,
                     <span class="variable">msec</span>)</code></dt>
<dd>
  Invokes <code class="variable">callback</code> after at
  least <code class="variable">msec</code> milliseconds have
  elapsed. Unlike <code>setTimeout</code> in web
  browsers, <code class="variable">callback</code> can't be a
  string: Always use a function instead. For example:
<pre class="example">
setTimeout(function () { log('time\'s up!'); }, 60 * 1000);
</pre>
  This prints <code>time's up</code> to the log after one minute. If
  you want an event to continually fire (like <code>setInterval</code>
  does in the browser) just call <code>setTimeout</code> again to
  re-arm your callback:
<pre class="example">
function f() {
  log('time passes');
  setTimeout(f, 1000);
}
setTimeout(f, 1000);
</pre>
  This will print <code>time passes</code> to the console roughly
  every second.
</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Debugging JavaScript Effects</h2>
<p>
  There isn't a debugger for JavaScript effects. Instead you can use
  the <code>log</code> function to output diagnostic messages. They
  appear in the console at the bottom of the effect settings panel.
</p>
<pre class="example">
log('Hello, world!');
</pre>
<!-- TODO: screenshot of message in log -->
<p>
  Messages are only logged while the effect settings are visible, to
  avoid slowing down your code during normal operation.
