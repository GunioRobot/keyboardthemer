        The <b>Plasma Effect</b> animates a demoscene plasma
        [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_effect">Wikipedia</a>]
        on your keyboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can vary the <b>Frequency</b>, <b>Offset</b>
        and <b>Power</b> of each of the
        four <b>Red</b>, <b>Green</b>, <b>Blue</b> and <b>Alpha</b>
        components individually.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lower <b>Frequency</b> settings result in
          &#145;smoother&#146; variations. At one extreme, by sliding
          all the way to the left, you get the same intensity on every
          key. At the other extreme, by sliding all the way to the
          right, you can very sharp points and striations.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <b>Offset</b> is useful for controlling how components
          at roughly the same frequency mix together. For example,
          putting red at offset zero, green at offset 1/3 and blue at
          offset 2/3 with the same frequency means red, green and blue
          will all appear, because each component will reach its peak
          intensity at a different time. Alternatively, if you put red
          and green at the same offset with the same frequency you
          won't see red or green but yellow&mdash;the result of mixing
          red and green light is yellow&mdash;because the red and
          green components will reach their peak intensity at the same
          time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, the <b>Speed</b> setting changes how quickly the
          plasma moves. If you drag the slider all the way to the left
          the plasma doesn't move, and you can use the Plasma Effect to
          create an interesting static background.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Plasma Effect has a lot of settings, so experiment with
        them to see the range of plasmas you can generate. To get
        started, drag the <b>Power</b> slider of the green and blue
        components to the left, and drag the <b>Frequency</b>
        and <b>Offset</b> sliders of the alpha component all the way
        to the left (but leave the <b>Power</b> slider of the alpha
        component all the way to the right.) This effectively turns
        off green and blue and leaves alpha constant so you can
        concentrate on the effect of varying
        the <b>Frequency</b>, <b>Offset</b> and <b>Power</b> of the
        red component in isolation. Some of the most striking plasma
        backgrounds use a single color this way. Then experiment with
        mixing in some green, and later blue and alpha.
