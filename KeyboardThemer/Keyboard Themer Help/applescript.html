  AppleScript is a scripting language with an English-language like
  syntax. You can use the <b>AppleScript Effect</b> to set the color
  of all of the keys on the keyboard via AppleScript. Scripting your
  keyboard with AppleScript is a good choice when you want to
  integrate with other applications on your computer. If you want to
  react to key presses, design animated effects, or download
  webpages, <a href="javascript.html">JavaScript effects</a> are a
  better choice.
</p>
<p>
  For example, if you want to illuminate particular keys when you have
  unread items in Mail or when a particular application is frontmost,
  you must use an AppleScript effect because a JavaScript effect can't
  interrogate Mail to see whether it has unread items or detect which
  application is frontmost.
</p>
<p>
  If you are new to AppleScript, you should read
  <a href="http://www.apple.com/applescript/firsttutorial/index.html">
  AppleScript: The Language of Automation</a> first.
</p>
<h2>Getting Started with AppleScript Effects</h2>
<p>
  Unlike JavaScript effects, you don't write AppleScript in Keyboard
  Themer. Instead you use an external application like <b>Automator</b>
  or <b>Script Editor</b> (which you can find in
  the <b>Applications</b> and
  <b>Applications: AppleScript</b> folders) or <code>oascript</code>
  (which you run from <b>Terminal</b>).
</p>
<p>
  The effects palette in Keyboard Themer has an effect called
  &quot;AppleScript&quot;. For the colors you set from AppleScript to
  show up at all, you must add an AppleScript effect to the applied
  effects and make it visible. Then the colors you set via AppleScript
  will appear on the keyboard.
</p>
<p>
  To set the color of keys, you must first address your document; then
  you can address individual keys within the context of the
  document. Here is how to address a document:
</p>
<pre class="example">
tell document &quot;Untitled&quot; of application &quot;KeyboardThemer&quot;
  -- set the key colors here
end tell
</pre>
<p>
  You can control both the color and opacity of each key
  individually. By default keys are completely transparent so any
  effects underneath the AppleScript effect show through, so you
  usually want to set both color and opacity. You specify color with a
  RGB triple like this: <code>{65535, 0, 0}</code>. The color
  components range from 0 to 65535, so <code>{65535, 0, 0}</code> is
  bright red, <code>{0, 65535, 0}</code> is bright green, and so
  on. Opacity is a number between 0.0 (completely transparent) and 1.0
  (completely opaque).
</p>
<p>
  For example, to set the 'A' key solid, bright yellow, you would
  write:
</p>
<pre class="example">
tell document &quot;Untitled&quot; of application &quot;KeyboardThemer&quot;
  set color of key &quot;A&quot; to {65535, 65535, 0}
  set opacity of key &quot;A&quot; to 1.0
end tell
</pre>
<p>
  You can address keys by name as demonstrated here&mdash;see
  the <a href="keys.html">key name reference</a> for a complete list
  of names&mdash;or by index, starting from the ~ key at index one,
  and proceeding roughly left-to-right, top-to-bottom across the
  keyboard.
</p>
<p>
  AppleScript can also set all keys, or runs of keys, at once. For
  example, the following script makes the entire keyboard transparent
  red, but illuminates the middle row in solid white:
</p>
<pre class="example">
tell document &quot;Untitled&quot; of application &quot;KeyboardThemer&quot;
  set color of every key to {65535, 0, 0}
  set opacity of every key to 0.5
  set color of key &quot;A&quot; thru key &quot;L&quot; to {65535, 65535, 65535}
  set opacity of key &quot;A&quot; thru key &quot;L&quot; to 1.0
end tell
</pre>
<h2>An Example AppleScript Effect: Unread Mail Items</h2>
<p>
  The real power of AppleScript comes from integrating multiple
  applications with a script. This script asks the Mail application
  how many unread items are in your inbox, and if there are unread
  items, it makes the ~ key bright green:
</p>
<pre class="example">
repeat
  -- get the number of unread items
  tell application &quot;Mail&quot;
    set unread_count to the unread count of inbox
  end tell

  -- update the status light
  tell document &quot;Untitled&quot; of application &quot;KeyboardThemer&quot;
    if unread_count > 0 then
      set color of key &quot;~&quot; to {0, 65535, 0}
      set opacity of key &quot;~&quot; to 1.0
    else
      set opacity of key &quot;~&quot; to 0.0
    end if
  end tell

  -- check again in a minute
  delay 60
end repeat
</pre>
<p>
  Real scripts require more sophistication that this&mdash;this one
  has the annoying property of starting Mail every minute if it is not
  running&mdash;but it demonstrates the idea of combining applications
  through script.
</p>
<h2>Debugging AppleScript Effects</h2>
<p>
  There isn't a debugger for AppleScript effects. Instead you can use
  the <code>display dialog</code> command to output diagnostic messages:
</p>
<pre class="example">
display dialog &quot;Hello, world!&quot; buttons { &quot;OK&quot; }
</pre>
<div class="figure">
<img src="display_dialog.png"
    alt="The dialog produced by the display dialog command" />
</div>
    </div>
